  <a href="https://www.upmforestlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UPM Forest Life</a></h1>
</strong></dt>
<dd> UPM Forest Life takes students across international borders to forests of Finland. The site features an interactive map that includes details about forest-dwelling species, information about the current efforts of forestry workers, and how these forests are used responsibly in Finland for recreation. Students and teachers can explore the map at their own pace or discover specific learning opportunities throughout the virtual landscape.<br>($7000.45)</dd>

 </strong></dt>
<dd> The Red Planet has once again captured human interest as NASA looks to the not-so-distant future of a manned mission to Mars. Students can discover how current technologies are helping prepare for the journey, what travel technologies are in development to enable the trip, and where innovation is needed to help the mission crews survive in the Martian environment.<br>($7000.95)</dd>

</strong></dt>
<dd>Science happens everywhere — and that includes the NASCAR racetracks. Spark! Online Education features STEAM-driven activities to help students see the real-world applications of science on the speedway. Students can learn about subjects ranging from creating aerodynamic car models, to discovering how energy types impact race outcomes, and understanding the role of sound in NASCAR racing. Start your engines — it’s science time!($8000.25)</dd>

  <a href="https://learntoconserve.com/internet-of-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IoT: Infinite Possibilities</a></h1>
</strong></dt>
<dd>The Internet of Things is everywhere, but how exactly does it work? More importantly, how can it be used to improve life on Earth? This virtual field trip explores how IoT technology can be used to manage two critical resources — energy and water — and create safe, sustainable communities. Plus, teachers can download the companion Educator Guide to build their own lessons around IoT.<br>($9000.95)</dd>

</strong></dt>
<dd>How well do you really know the solar system? Most of us can name the eight planets (poor Pluto!) and have a reasonably solid grasp on the structure of our solar neighborhood. The Solar System Scope takes things a step farther with an interactive map of our local cosmic community. Kids can use the map to see where each planet is located relative to the sun, click on it for more information about its surface and internal structure, and see how these planets appear in our night sky.
